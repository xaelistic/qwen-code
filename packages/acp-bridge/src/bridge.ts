/**
 * Stage 1 HTTP->ACP bridge factory + supporting helpers.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   - **1 daemon = 1 workspace**: every bridge instance is bound to a
 *     single canonical workspace path at construction
 *     (`BridgeOptions.boundWorkspace`). All `spawnOrAttach` calls must
 *     target that workspace; cross-workspace requests throw
 *     `WorkspaceMismatchError`. Multi-workspace deployments use multiple
 *     daemon processes (one per workspace, supervised externally).
 *   - One `qwen --acp` child total; multiple sessions multiplex onto it
 *     via `connection.newSession()`. Sessions share the child's process /
 *     OAuth state / `FileReadCache` / hierarchy-memory parse.
 *   - HTTP request bodies are forwarded as ACP NDJSON over the child's stdin.
 *   - Child stdout NDJSON notifications publish onto each session's
 *     `EventBus`; HTTP SSE subscribers (`GET /session/:id/events`) drain
 *     it. Cross-client fan-out + `Last-Event-ID` reconnect supported.
 *   - Multi-client requests against the same session serialize through this
 *     bridge (FIFO; honors ACP's "one active prompt per session" invariant).
 *     Different sessions on the same channel can prompt concurrently —
 *     the ACP layer demultiplexes by sessionId.
 *
 * Stage 2 replaces the spawn step with an in-process call into core's
 * ACP-equivalent API. The `AcpSessionBridge` interface stays the same so HTTP
 * route handlers don't need to change.

/**
 * Race `p` against a timeout. The timeout REJECTS the returned
 * promise but does NOT abort the underlying operation — `p` keeps
 * running to completion (or its own failure) and its eventual
 * resolution is silently dropped.
 *
 * Stage 1 limitation: for `unstable_setSessionModel` the agent may
 * complete the model switch AFTER we surfaced the timeout to the
 * HTTP caller, leading to drift between caller's perceived model
 * and agent's actual model. Subscribers also see contradictory
 * SSE events (`model_switch_failed` from the timeout, then a late
 * `model_switched` if the agent succeeds). Acceptable for Stage 1
 * because:
 *   1. ACP's `unstable_setSessionModel` doesn't accept a cancel
 *      signal yet (the SDK's `prompt` does, hence `sendPrompt`'s
 *      explicit `cancel` notification on abort).
 *   2. Model switches complete in milliseconds in practice; a
 *      timeout firing means the agent is genuinely wedged, not
 *      just slow, and would have been DOA anyway.
 * Stage 2 will add abort plumbing once ACP exposes a cancel hook
 * for `unstable_setSessionModel`. Tracked in the model-change
 * concurrency notes in `applyModelServiceId`. BSA0C suggested a
 * `modelSwitchTimedOut` flag + `model_switch_late_success`
 * synthetic frame for full observability of the divergent state;
 * recorded as a Stage 2 follow-up so the timeout/late-success
 * handshake is implemented once across both ACP-side cancel and
 * the bridge-side state flag (rather than just papering over the
 * symptom).
