/**
 * Centralized error taxonomy for ACP bridge operations.
 *
 * Each class is a structurally-distinct subclass of `Error` that the
 * HTTP route layer (and embedded callers) can `instanceof`-branch on
 * to map to a specific status code without text-matching the message.
 * The fields on each class (`sessionId`, `bound`/`requested`, `limit`,
 * etc.) are the structured payload that `sendBridgeError` surfaces in
 * the JSON body, so SDK consumers can render typed prompts (e.g.
 * "session limit reached, retry after N seconds") without parsing
 * free-form text.
 *
 *
 * The bridge package owns the error contract directly. The
 * 7 error classes server.ts imports + 1 each from workspaceAgents.ts
 * and workspaceMemory.ts continue to resolve through the
 * httpAcpBridge.ts re-export shim.
